A well-written script is organized, readable, and maintainable. It follows a logical structure, making it easy for others (and your future self) to understand and modify. The `secscan.sh` script provides a good example of this structure.

Here are the key components of a well-written script:

### 1. Header and Metadata

- **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`):** The first line specifies the interpreter to be used, ensuring the script runs in the correct environment.
- **Descriptive Header:** A comment block at the top should briefly explain the script's purpose, what it does, and any important notes.
- **Versioning and Script Name:** Global variables for the `VERSION` and `SCRIPT_NAME` make the script easier to manage and reference.
- **list of changes made along with the version

### 2. Structured Code Blocks

- **Sections:** Use comments like `--- Section Name ---` to divide the script into logical parts, such as documentation, setup, core functions, and main execution logic. This greatly improves readability.
- **Functions:**
    - **Modularity:** Break down the script's logic into self-contained functions, each with a single, clear purpose (e.g., `usage`, `check_deps`, `phase1_recon`).
    - **Descriptive Naming:** Function names should clearly indicate what they do.
    - **Goal-Oriented Comments:** Each function or logical block should have a comment explaining its high-level goal, rather than just restating the code.

### 3. User Interaction and Robustness

- **Usage Information:** A `usage()` function is essential for explaining how to use the script, including its command-line arguments and options. It should be displayed if the script is run with incorrect or missing arguments.
- **Dependency Checks:** A function like `check_deps()` verifies that all required tools (e.g., `nmap`) are installed before the script attempts to run, preventing unexpected errors.
- **Argument Parsing:** Use `getopts` to handle command-line flags and arguments in a robust and standard way.
- **Input Validation:** Always validate user-provided input to ensure the script runs correctly and to provide helpful error messages.

### 4. Main Execution Logic

- **`main()` Function:** The primary logic of the script should be contained within a `main()` function. This function orchestrates the calls to other functions.
- **Execution Flow:** The `main` function should be clean and easy to follow, showing the high-level steps the script will take.
- **Call to Main:** The script should end with `main "$@"` to pass all command-line arguments to the main function, initiating the script's execution.
